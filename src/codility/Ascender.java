		 * Consider a zero-indexed array A of N integers. Indices of this array
		 * are integers from 0 to N-1. Take an index K. Index J is called an
		 * ascender of K if A[J] > A[K]. Note that if A[K] is a maximal value in
		 * the array A, then K has no ascenders. Ascender J of K is called the
		 * closest ascender of K if abs(K-J) is the smallest possible value
		 * (that is, if the distance between J and K is minimal). Note that K
		 * can have at most two closest ascenders: one smaller and one larger
		 * than K.
		 * 
		 * For example, let us consider the following array A: A[0] = 4 A[1] = 3
		 * A[2] = 1 A[3] = 4 A[4] = -1 A[5] = 2 A[6] = 1 A[7] = 5 A[8] = 7
		 * 
		 * If K = 3 then K has two ascenders: 7 and 8. Its closest ascender is 7
		 * and distance between K and 7 equals abs(K-7) = 4.
		 * 
		 * For example, given the following array A: A[0] = 4 A[1] = 3 A[2] = 1
		 * A[3] = 4 A[4] = -1 A[5] = 2 A[6] = 1 A[7] = 5 A[8] = 7
		 * 
		 * the function should return the following array R: R[0] = 7 R[1] = 1
		 * R[2] = 1 R[3] = 4 R[4] = 1 R[5] = 2 R[6] = 1 R[7] = 1 R[8] = 0
